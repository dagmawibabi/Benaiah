<ArticleHeader content="Jehovah-Immeka:-Lord Is With You (To The Reach)" />

As lonely as it gets, and as the comfort of the world flees from my being, the consolation of the earth is shaken, and solitude rots in my veins. As I escape to the corner of the surrendered, the land of the defeated, as loneliness deepens and there seems to be nowhere to find closure, with the air void and the violent wind taking my breath away, **I know my lover is there**. On my lowest days, he will guide; he will sit with the brokenhearted and listen to their cry. In his presence, my wounds are tended, my sorrow met with grace, and my weakness clothed in strength. And in the stillness of my struggle, when I find his embrace so far away, on those lifeless days of mine, I know my lover lingers nearer than my own breath. **(Judges 6:12-13, 16)**

As my days become fountains of hope, where laughter and happiness cascade, as my feet leap and my faith sprouts, when my seasons are full of life and I’m surrounded by loved ones, oh, on those days also, my lover is ever so close.  **Psalm 16:11 (NIV)**

Where can I flee from Your presence, O Lord of my soul?  Wherever I dud, You go; wherever I succeed, the victory is Yours. You’re with me to the end of the age, to the last of the day, to the depth of the darkness, to the profundity of the light. Wherever my feet  arrive, my Lord, to the reach, You’ll drive. **Matthew 28:20 (NIV): "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." (Psalm 139:7-10 (NIV),Romans 8:38-39 (NIV),Isaiah 41:10 (NIV))**
