<ArticleHeader content="Jehovah - Immeka: Lord Is With You" />

I sometimes wonder what I'm in the middle of and whom I can shout to. At times I question whether I even have anyone beside this cracked soul of mine. In the midst of despair and hurt, when I can't see the brighter side—when the bright side I used to hope for has disappeared and when my help is no longer near—I feel trapped in this prison of life. I no longer feel brave, and my arms are breaking. When I feel like a disgrace, of no use, and I can't lift my head up, the voices inside my head clash with the truth that seems great. The fire looks intense, for my storm is so dense, and the wound is so deep that it seems not to heal. Even though I'm wandering in the wilderness, and the thought of belonging is a mess, though my God seems far from my gaze, I know heartily there is only one undeniable truth: that **He is still with me.**

<br />

I have often felt like David when he said, “I cried out to the Lord in my distress, but I would not be comforted; but I remembered you, God, and I groaned. I meditated, and my spirit grew faint; I was troubled to speak. I thought about the former days; I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated, and my spirit asked, 'Will the Lord reject forever? Has His promises failed? Has His unfailing love vanished?' Then I thought, to this I will appeal: I said this is my weakness. I will remember the mighty deeds of the Lord; **yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago”**.I  also cry out to the Lord: this is my lameness; this is my flaw. Whenever He seems so distant, that's when He's more close. 

<br />

I don't fear nor be dismayed, for He is my God and He is with me.Isaiah 41:10 (NIV). Even though I'm troubled and my answer is delayed, **the One who is with me is greater than what is dreaded and made.** Alone is not in his dictionary; alone is not in his plan, to leave me by myself, to the evil that lurks in the shadows, where abandonment and fears intertwine. Yeah, this is my weakness; this is my flaw: to deny His presence in the middle of the storm, to forget the days that He stood by me in my misery. I recall His faithfulness; I recall His devotion, for sorrow can't separate Him, for He stood by me then and now and forever.**"God is with us, and that is the key to our joy and peace. His presence gives us the strength to live faithfully, no matter the trials."[6]**

**"The presence of God in our life is not something to be felt, it is a fact to be embraced."[4]**

As in the story of  Job, at the time of his grief and pain when he had lost everything he held dear, he claimed that he couldn’t sense God’s presence. Yet, in his sorrow,  when God seemed nowhere to be found, he declared his faith; His  God knew His  way and was still with Him . **Job 23:8-10 (NIV)** “But if I go to the east, He is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find Him. When He is at work in the north, I do not see Him; when He turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of Him. But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.”

<br />

In Psalms, David cried out in desperation, for he thought for a moment  that God had forsaken him: **Psalm 22:1 (NIV)** “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?”But, David later he claims His faithfulness in the same psalm: **Psalm 22:24 (NIV)** “For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.”  David reminds us that even in moments of despair, God’s silence does not mean His absence.**“God is with me every step of the way, guiding me, protecting me, even when the path is uncertain."[3]**

<br />

Again, in the book of Habakkuk, the prophet argued with God about His silence in the face of injustice. The book of Habakkuk is a unique prophetic text that captures a heartfelt dialogue between the prophet and God. Written during a time of moral decay and injustice. He questioned why God seemed to tolerate wrongdoing and remain silent amidst oppression: **Habakkuk 1:2 (NIV)** “How long, Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, ‘Violence!’ but you do not save?” 

<br />

However, as the story unfolds, Habakkuk comes to understand that God’s plans transcend human understanding. He concludes with a powerful statement of faith: **Habakkuk 3:17-18 (NIV)** “Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior.” **“God is always present. The soul that has learned to keep God’s presence knows peace and joy in His company, no matter the circumstances."[1]**

<br />

God’s silence is not evidence of His absence. His faithfulness persists, and His plans are beyond our realization. We are called to trust in Him, even when we cannot see or feel His presence. The ways of God are beyond our knowledge, and we cannot predict how He will move. All we know is that He is faithful enough to stand with us and walk with us. He is near to those who trust in Him, and He is not the kind of God who will forsake us after calling us into His presence. We are in His aura; He is closer than we imagine, dwelling within our very being. **"To be known by God, to know His presence is a gift to every soul who seeks Him. God is always nearer than we think, for He is within us, around us, and beside us."**[5]


<ArticleHeader content="There Is No Place That God Is Not Present" />

**My heart fills with joy when I think of this, for I know that even if I make my bed in the depths, He is still with me.** There is no place-whether in joy, despair, or seclusion-where God is not present. Even when I feel burdened and abandoned, my God is ever-present. David said, **Psalm 139:7-10 (NIV)**: “Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.” Oh God, who is true and  reliable, where can I go from your presence? For You are everywhere, and every existence is Yours. I now also know that God, no matter the circumstance and the distress, Your presence and help do not depend on it but on the loyalty of Your love. **"God is always with us, even in our deepest flaws and brokenness. His presence does not depend on our perfection but on His love for us.”**[2]
