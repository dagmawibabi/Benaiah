As we live in this fallen world we are constantly facing what could be referred to as “the normal life” by other people, a life full of stress, depression, and anxiety, people can't think of a life that could be free from these.

<br/>

We find our hearts troubled, seeking a place of refuge, scared as we all wait for what tomorrow unfolds- the uncertainty of the unseen keeps our minds busy and anxious even though we are incapable of changing what it holds. We struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
But Jesus, the prince of peace, tells our hearts a different story '... Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 'John 14:27

<br/>

One of the fruits of The Holy Spirit is peace “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” Galatians 5:22 NIV. The only way that we have true peace is through the Holy Spirit. His residence in us brings peace to our lives; the kind that is only accessible through God which will protect our minds and hearts.

<br/>

God is peace, He is faithful enough to lift up our hearts and raise our spirits again from the pits we might find ourselves in; in Him lies the rest, He has the remedy to all of our problemsH,he is the God who listens to our hearts, we just need to ask for help.
