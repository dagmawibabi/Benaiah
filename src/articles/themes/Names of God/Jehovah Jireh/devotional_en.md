He stretched out the sky and laid the earth beneath it. He whispered and life took form. Above all, at the height and end of it all, He formed humanity and carved us with care. He breathed His own breath into us; His very essence — His form of life.

<br/>

He springs water from the mountains, quenching the thirst of wild creatures. He feeds the lives He whispered into being, and they look upon Him without shame. He takes care of them. And if He cares for them, how much more will He care for us, who share in His very breath?

<br/>

Matthew 6:26 (NIV): “Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?” Indeed, we are the ones He gave His life and lost His dignity for, spat upon for, and died for. If He cares so deeply for us, how could He not provide for us? He is the God of providence, watching over birds and wild creatures, with every form of life relying on Him. Beyond all of that, His love for us surpasses it all.

<br/>

Why, then, do we rattle with the waves of doubt, as if hesitation and sadness can provide for us? Let us cast all our shadows on Him and see through the trial with hope in the good. Why do we waver in a drought of faith, as if we are the ones who remain and fight, when the King is faithful for a lifetime to provide?
