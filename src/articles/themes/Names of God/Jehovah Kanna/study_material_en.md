<ArticleHeader content="Jehovah Kanna - Jealous God" />

We, as humans, are unique among all creatures because we were created in the image of God. Although there is a clear creator-creature distinction that highlights our limitedness and God's unlimitedness, **there is a sense of Godlikeness in our humanity**. This is reflected in how we carry ourselves.

<br />

We have inherited many features from our Creator, including the ability to feel deeply. We feel compassion when we see someone facing difficulties. We feel love for others and often go above and beyond to be loved in return. We feel anger when our weaknesses are triggered, and we experience jealousy when someone has something we deeply value but cannot attain.

<ArticleHeader content="Jealousy" />

Jealousy is an unpleasant feeling, isn’t it? There’s something inherently off about it. It makes us feel defiled, strips away our sense of comfort, pulls the rug of security out from under our feet, and leaves us unstable. But above all, it makes us feel weak. It reveals our sense of incapability, leading to envy, rage, and even hatred. (Proverbs 27:4)

<br />

Jealousy is not a positive experience because it doesn’t stem from fullness but rather from lack. **Wherever there is jealousy, there is some form of lack or unmet need**. Our failure as humanity has made it possible for us to imitate God in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. As a result, our jealousy is often unholy, selfish, and sinful, stemming from an evil desire to validate ourselves with the things we believe could fulfill us. With the yeast of sin within our flesh, we often end up bitter and ungrateful.

<br />

But jealousy is not something we feel because humanity fell from the glory of God in the Garden of Eden. It is something we have as part of being created in the image of God. We experience jealousy because God can be jealous too. In fact, He identified Himself as jealous.

<ArticleHeader content="His name is Jealous" />

_Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. Exodus 34 : 14_

<br />

God identifies Himself with His name, and here it is as if He is saying, “Hi, my name is Jealous.” With God being holy in a transcendent and perfect way, His jealousy does not make Him any less holy—obviously, and that is not the point.

<br />

But if we say that jealousy arises from some form of lack, how is it possible for God to lack anything?

<br />

When we unpack this with the official definition of what jealousy means, Merriam Webster defines jealousy as _“a jealous disposition, attitude, or feeling that carries the particular sense of **“zealous vigilance”** and tends to be applied more exclusively to feelings of protectiveness regarding one’s own advantages or attachments.”_ The highlight of the definition is **zealous vigilance**—meaning passionate attentiveness to something that is important to us. It’s essential to note that **jealousy only arises over something that deeply matters  to us**. We don’t show zeal for things that are of no value in our hearts.

<br />

So, when God proclaimed Himself to be a Jealous God in the Bible, it shows that something is very important to Him: **worship**. But here’s the question; God has always been worshiped, even before humanity existed. The hosts of heaven have been and will continue to worship Him constantly (Revelation 4:8, Isaiah 6:3).

**If God has never lacked worship, why is He so invested in His people worship Him to the point of identifying Himself as Jealous?**

<ArticleHeader content="Why Worship?" />

**God created us out of love so that He could love us, and worship is the only right state of being that allows us to receive His love**. Worship means “respectful devotion—loving, honoring, and obeying someone who deserves our highest regard.” It seems to be an active state of being, a lifestyle devoted solely to God. Worship means faithfulness and loyalty. It is choosing God over whatever seems attractive to our eyes and loving Him with all our heart, mind, and soul._(Matthew 22:37)_ It also involves surrendering our own thoughts about certain things and submitting to His definition of them.

<br />

We mentioned that we only get jealous over things that matter to us, and the same is true for God. **Worship matters to God not because our worship adds anything to His glory, but because, in worship, we are willingly saying we belong to Him and under the shadow of  His love.** 

<br />

When God proclaims that "His name is Jealous," it is another way of saying, “**I love you, you are mine**, and you are deeply important to me.” He has demonstrated His devoted love time and time again, but most profoundly, **He proved how important we are to Him when He allowed His only Son to die so that He could love us righteously. Worship, then, is how we respond to His love in the only right way, by faithfully devoting ourselves to Him.**

<ArticleHeader content="Covenant" />

The best thing about marriage is that it serves as God’s metaphor for the love He has for us. We see this when the people of Israel rejected God’s command to worship only Him and devoted themselves to other gods. In response, God didn’t just call them transgressors but adulterers. "Adulterer" is a name tag for those who break a covenant by committing adultery with someone other than the one they are in a covenant relationship with. This shows that the Israelites were in a covenant relationship with God by being ancestors of Abraham, like we are today through Christ.

<br />

Just as a marriage covenant is a lifelong promise to love and not leave one another, the covenant we have with God through the blood of Christ Jesus is also eternal. Earlier, we mentioned that jealousy often arises from lack, and while this is true, when we look at God’s fullness, even before humanity existed, it reveals a deeper truth: where there is jealousy, there is love. We see this in how the more the Israelites made Him jealous with other gods, the more He called them back home. 

<br />

**Unlike our unholy jealousy, which seeks to fill something we are missing, God’s jealousy is a call to the glory of Him that we are missing by dividing our hearts with things other than Him.** Unlike our jealousy, which is destructive, God’s jealousy is restorative. He is not calling us to fill Himself with our often imperfect worship, but for us to share the eternal life He gives, be part of His Kingdom and reign with Him. He does not give up on us because we mess up; instead, the more we mess up, the more He gets jealous for us. His jealousy overflows with faithful love, calling us back to Him from whatever wrong commitments we are entangled in.

<br />

And as the bride of Christ, just as two people must devote themselves to building their relationship, trust, and love to make their marriage work, we must also bring that same devotion to our relationship with our Lord.

<ArticleHeader content="The Story of Grace" />

It must be shrinking to be called an adulterer, with the flame of its shame burning the insides of us. Yet, despite the number of idols we place on the high altars of our hearts, we don’t feel ashamed. We’ve grown so accustomed to the “making an idol out of everything” lifestyle that we don’t even flinch or are aware when a new god is introduced to our hearts. But the truth is, we are committing adultery when we devote ourselves to anything or anyone other than God. For the bible calls us to flee from worshiping an idol ( 1 Corinthians 10:14 (NLT))

<br />

Reading the story of the Israelites, I used to get so annoyed by most of the things they did, especially for always coming up with new gods with strange names to bow down to. It seemed like they needed to be told the same thing a million times and  they usually end up sinning anyway. I imagined how frustrating it must have been for God and questioned why He couldn’t just give up and leave them. Until, one day, He gently enlightened me on how not so different I am. It was a big "aha" moment that made me realize the idols in my own life that I had been bowing down to unconsciously. He also showed me that **the same patience of God that waited on the Israelites with love is the reason why I am still here**. Since then, I have never found their story annoying, but rather a beautiful reminder of God’s love, patience, and grace.

<br />

<ArticleHeader content="The Modern Day Idols" />

Idols have become so tricky to track nowadays. We don’t need to name them or build altars on the mountains like in the old days for them to be gods. As Christ lives in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, modern-day small gods also seek to occupy the altars of our hearts.

<br />

They can take the form of friendships we feel we can’t survive without, a marriage we seek daily affirmation from but that is never enough, children we can’t take our eyes off, work and success we try to distract and fill ourselves with, or money in which we look for our worth. All of these can become idols. Although these things aren’t inherently bad, as long as we are trying to fill the emptiness inside us with them, we are attempting to replace God and the true fulfillment only He can offer. **Our desperation for love, attention and affirmation is part of God’s design to draw us to Him every day.** 

<br />

If there are people, positions, or belongings we feel we can’t live without, we must rethink their place in our lives. If we turn to entertainment for comfort when our days grow blue, we must reconsider where we are heading and guard ourselves against emotional adultery. Any part of our life that is not submitted to the Lordship of Jesus—dividing our hearts from God—must be repented of and repositioned into its right place.


**Only God is the true Lord, and only He is worthy of our fully devoted hearts.**
