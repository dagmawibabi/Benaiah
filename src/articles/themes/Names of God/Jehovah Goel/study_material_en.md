<ArticleHeader content="Jehovah-Goel-Lord My redeemer-(Twice Mine)" />


It warms my heart, thinking of this. Though I once belonged to the thief and the hell of the soul, but now I am redeemed. Oh, you may say, "What a luck!" But it wasn‚Äôt. It was the one and only of His kind‚Äìthe unparalleled‚Äìwho bought me back, for I was His from the beginning of the earth.
 
<br /> 
 
I once heard a story about a wealthy man from olden days who had built a boat with his own hands. He poured his heart into it, giving it his all, and made it truly beautiful. But one day, after returning from using the boat, he tied it to the shore, hoping to find it just as he had left it. However, when he went back to his home and later came to check on it, it was gone‚Äìthe boat wasn‚Äôt there. Oh, for a man who dirtied his hands and exhausted himself to build it, what a sadness, what a grief! He wept.
 
<br /> 
 
Decades passed like a flowing river; time flew like an eagle. The man sorrowed, until one day, while passing by a boat showroom, he saw his own creation‚Äìa boat he had built with his own bare hands, the one he had poured his all into. There it was, now for sale.
 
<br /> 
 
It was no longer his; it belonged to the seller. It wasn't kept well‚Äìthe thief hadn't taken care of it, he hadn‚Äôt valued it. it had been sold from one person after another, treated only as a tool for making money. The man came closer and asked for the price. He didn‚Äôt shout, he didn‚Äôt despair; he simply asked. And then, without hesitation, he bought it back, paying more than it took when he built it‚Äîas if it had never been his before. And on the boat, he wrote these words: ‚ÄúThis boat is mine twice: once by making it, and once by buying it.‚Äù
 
<br /> 
 
And there I am, the lost one, lost by my own choice, the child that abandoned his father, the belonging that betrayed the owner. The man wept, the owner of my soul despaired. It's not that I was all he had, but I was all he wanted. Oh, for a man who poured his heart and soul into loving mine, what an anguish, what a melancholy. For a lover who made heaven a life just to love me there, what a distress I made.
 
<br /> 
 
I then belonged to the thief, the thief I gave myself to, the thief I trusted more than the one who crafted my whole being. But I wasn't taken care of; I hadn't had a home. The one I trusted more than the man who gave me his all, he toyed with my body, he played with my mind and heart, he made my soul hellish. I wasn't loved, I wasn't adored, treasured, or cherished as I used to be. I used to be held dear, like matchless and irreplaceable. And then I became worthless.
  
<br /> 
 
And on the other half, the man was angered, provoked, enraged, agitated, and raged. The man felt blue, mourned, and sorrowed. But then the man missed, craved, ached for me, and recalled the greater love he had, and he could not give up on me.
 
<br /> 
 
And here is why I say it wasn‚Äôt luck, it wasn't an accident. He held me in his heart for so long, and he couldn‚Äôt bear losing me. Though I was a betrayal itself, I was so worthwhile and precious to him. And he came. He looked for me in the crowd, he searched for me in hopeless places, he sought me where souls are sold. There I was‚Äîenslaved, captive, imprisoned, and laboring under the weight of death. 
Oh, for a man who loved me enough to give his all‚Äîto see me like that, to see his love suffering and engraved with pain. And then, He was ready to make me His again, to buy me back, to pay the price of my sorrow, to heavenize me once more. And there He was‚Äîthe price was the soul of a man who had never sinned, pure and a king. The price was His very soul. Oh, for a man who loved enough to give his all‚Äîwasn‚Äôt it more than enough to surrender his honor and respect, to be made like me? But then, to give his soul.The man wept blood. There was no doubt, pause, or hesitation‚Äîthe man bought me back with the price of his blood. Oh, for a man who loved more than enough to give his all‚Äîgiving himself away was that easy. And there I belong to Him again. What a redeeming and rescuing love!!üò≠ü•π

Isaiah 43:1 (NIV): "But now, this is what the Lord says‚Äîhe who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.' " 1 Peter 1:18-19 (NIV): "For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect." Ephesians 1:7 (NIV): "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God‚Äôs grace." Galatians 3:13 (NIV): "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.'" (Luke 15:4-7 (NIV), Colossians 1:13-14 (NIV), Titus 2:14 (NIV))

There was an adulterous woman  called Gomer in the Bible whom God commanded the prophet Hosea to marry. Hosea's name meant "deliverance." The woman symbolized Israel, who had turned away from God and worshiped other gods. Hosea married her and made her his own, as God commanded. Yet, despite his love, she continued to betray him repeatedly, seeking love from other men.
 
<br /> 
 
Still, Hosea waited for her, loving her unshakably. Eventually, the lovers she turned to used her beauty, drained her, and cast her away. Once her beauty faded, and she had nothing left, she became a slave, destined to be sold. But Hosea came to take her back. His love rescued her; he paid the price and redeemed her.
 
<br /> 
 
As God said about Israel in Hosea 2:14: ‚ÄúTherefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.‚Äù In the same way, Like her, we too have strayed and betrayed, but God speaks to our adulterous hearts. He paid the ultimate price and never grew tired of pursuing us, again and again. Just as Hosea redeemed his wife, God has redeemed us with an incomparable love.
 
<br /> 
 
Oh, we are unfaithful and deceitful, yet the Lover of our souls loves us despite who we are. He paid the price to bring us back to the home He prepared for us. We are now redeemed, and we belong to Him. We will sing like birds liberated from their cages (Hosea 2:15).He chased after us tirelessly, and His anger never boiled over, even though His heart burned with pain. Though He didn‚Äôt deserve any of this, He never wavered; He stood firm and steadfast in His love.
 
<br /> 
 
This is my Redeemer, and my heart was adulterous. I loved many, and I had gone too far. I craved sin and betrayed my God. For me, it seemed there was no way to be made new again, no way I could ever belong to the heavenly and pure King. But my Lover bled and breathed His last breath for me. I am redeemed, and God is my redeemer .

In our Bible, when Boaz redeemed Ruth, it doesn't merely show an act of restoring property (as her kinsman-redeemer); it reveals a pure and unconditional love when the woman had nothing to offer. Boaz didn‚Äôt need to redeem Ruth; he chose to because he loved her. Similarly, we didn‚Äôt even have the diligence to be liked as Ruth had in Boaz‚Äôs eyes. We were entirely undeserving of the ultimate price He paid for us.

Yet, God didn‚Äôt just pay a simple price or give something from His possessions. He, the supreme One over all creation, became our kinsman-redeemer, and the price was His only Son, who had never sinned.He bore the curse of the law that was meant for us. He became the curse on our behalf, fulfilling the words: ‚ÄúCursed is everyone who hangs on a tree‚Äù (Galatians 3:13). The cost of our redemption was not measured in silver or gold but in His precious blood. He ransomed us, purchased us, and called us His own at the price of His perfect, blameless life. 

<br /> 
 
Rescuing humanity from sin was not the work of man but the outpouring of God's immeasurable grace. We were cursed, deserving of judgment, yet now we stand blessed‚Äîundeserving, but embraced by mercy. The judgment of God, once unbearable, has turned to favor those in Christ. His standard is perfection‚Äîflawless righteousness, a standard no amount of good works, moral actions, religious rituals, sacrifices, or self-denial could ever meet. Not a single act of human merit could earn His favor or secure redemption.[2]

<br /> 
 
‚ÄúMan's total unrighteousness collides with God's perfect standard, eliminating any hope of redemption by effort. We were dead‚Äìtrapped in our transgressions and sins. And what power does a dead soul have to save itself? None.There was no power or capacity in a dead person, so we couldn‚Äôt do anything by our own strength. But God‚Äîrich in mercy and overflowing with love‚Äìintervened. ‚ÄúBecause of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgression‚Äìit is by grace you have been saved‚Äù (Ephesians 2:4-5). His redemption was regeneration, which now gave us the capacity to do things that please God. Redemption is not an achievement; it is a gift lavished upon us‚Äù.[2] ‚ÄúIn Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God‚Äôs grace that He lavished on us‚Äù (Ephesians 1:7-8).

<br /> 
 
Now, we are redeemed for a purpose‚Äìnot to earn His love, but to live out the good works He prepared for us. Election is God's work in the sinner, not the sinner's work toward God. It is He who sought us, He who saved us, and He who keeps us. We have redemption‚Äìnot as a trophy of our efforts, but as a testament to His grace. What a wondrous rescue it is‚Äìa story of love unearned, and mercy undeserved. We are twice His: He first made us, and then, once and for all, He bought us back.
 
<br /> 
 
‚ÄúJehovah Goel‚Äù, from the Hebrew ‚Äúga'al‚Äù (to redeem), means "The Lord, the Redeemer," acting as the ultimate kinsman-redeemer,He who redeems from slavery, sin, and death (Isaiah 43:14, Job 19:25). In Hebrew tradition, a goel rescues relatives from slavery (Leviticus 25:47-49), restores land (Leviticus 25:25), avenges justice (Numbers 35:19), and preserves lineage (Deuteronomy 25:5-10).
