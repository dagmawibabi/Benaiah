<ArticleHeader content="When Our Strength Runs Out, God’s Never Does" />

Life has a way of showing us just how limited our” strength” really is. You know those
moments when you hit a wall and feel like you have nothing left to give? That’s when we
realize what true strength really looks like, **and it’s found in God**. The best part? His
strength is always available, always abundant, waiting for us to trust Him.
Most people rely on backup plans, money, friends, or advice, but let’s be real, those can fail.
But God? His strength is steady, unbreakable, and ever-present. Imagine trying to build a
house on shifting sand versus a solid foundation. You wouldn&#39;t choose sand, right? But that&#39;s
often what we do when we rely on things that are temporary. Unlike those temporary
supports, God’s strength never falters. He’s our solid foundation, the rock that keeps us
steady when life’s storms come. Relying on our own strength is like building on shifting sand.
But with God as our source, we’re empowered not just to survive but to thrive.
Paul’s words in Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Him who gives me
strength,” resonate deeply. Before saying this, Paul reflects on facing both abundance and
need. His secret? God’s strength carried him through every circumstance. Isaiah 40:29
reminds us that God “gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.”
When life feels overwhelming, pause and rest in God’s presence. You don’t have to carry the
burden alone, He will sustain and strengthen you. As Isaiah 41:10 (NIV) assures us: “Do not
fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help
you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Trust in His unfailing strength, it never
runs out.
