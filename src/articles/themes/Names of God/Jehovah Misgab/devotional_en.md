<ArticleHeader content="Jehovah Misgab - A Place of Safety" />

From the earliest days of human history, war has been a part of life, continuing to exist even today in both physical and non physical forms. Perhaps our fight-or-flight response reflects this reality, as there is always something to fight against or flee from. We choose to fight only when we believe there’s a chance of winning, and in most of our wars, we know the only way to survive is to flee. When there is always something to flee from, whether it is bad company, problems, heartbreak, or sin, the question arises: where do we run?

<br />

_The name of the Lord is a strong tower;_
_The righteous runs to it and is safe and set on high [far above evil]._
_Proverbs 18:10(Amp)_

<br />

We can read “the name of the Lord is a strong tower,” as “the Lord Himself is a strong tower,” for God expresses Himself through His name, and His name represents His nature and glory (Exodus 33:18-23). There is a corresponding Hebrew name for that nature of God, Jehovah Misgab, meaning “God is my high tower."

<br />

In earlier days, when physical wars were common, people built strong and high towers to protect themselves from the enemy accessing them. Today, in a world filled with modern "high towers" like riches, connections, and status for modern wars, there is only One who is truly high and strong tower: God. When life takes on the theme of war against us, there is our God whom we can run to and be safe. When there is a need for safety, there is a supply mechanism, and it is called the name of the Lord.
