After the fall of mankind, brokenness, pain and destruction entered and prevailed without borders. There was nothing capable of stopping the consequences of sin but we see God, starting from one of the earliest stories in the Bible,  interfering, fighting, and saving His people. 

<br />

“She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21 NIV

<br />

The whole purpose and agenda of Jesus coming here to earth was to save His people from the slavery of sin. The name Jesus translates to the Lord saves. He came to repair and mend our brokenness, to save us from what separated us from God - our sins. 

<br />

Jesus healed a lot of people from many diseases, delivered people from demonic possessions, and saved the sinners. He is the hero and savior of our story with Wwhom we learn and grasp the healing nature of God in its fullness. We see that nothing comes before Hhim that is too mighty to keep us in despair and sickness cause He is the mighty God that goes by the name Jehovah Rapha. He has the power of healing and restoring anything.

<br />

Healing is one of the ways the Llord interferes forH his people. He takes pains away as if they never happened, He puts band-aid over the hurting wounds; He cleans gently, puts oil and covers it with clean cloth. He knows how to take care of Hhis people, runs with the strong ones, walks and carries the ones who are sick and weak. He never rushes or is ignorant to those who are in pain, He is gentle and caring,and goes through with patiently. He promises to be the shield and protection over Hhis people regardless of the situation.
