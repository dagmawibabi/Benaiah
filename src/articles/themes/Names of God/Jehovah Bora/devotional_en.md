_“For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through him and for him.” (Colossians 1:16 ESV)_

<br />

Do you ever wonder why you exist? Why does the sun rises each morning or why stars sprinkle the night sky? Colossians 1:16 gives us the answer: **everything was created by God and for His glory**,including you.

<br />

You weren’t an accident. The same God who shaped the galaxies handcrafted you, uniquely and wonderfully. You were made to reflect His greatness and beauty in ways that no one else can. The mountains shout His majesty, the oceans echo His power, and the stars sing His creativity. **But you? You bear His very image**. When you persevere through challenges, love others selflessly, or live with joy, you reflect His glory in a way that is unique to you as His image-bearer. 

<br />

And here’s the beautiful truth: glorifying God isn’t about being perfect. It’s about surrender, waking up each day and saying, “God, use me to show how amazing You are.” Whether it’s in your work, your relationships, or even quiet moments of prayer, you were made by Him, for Him, and for His glory.

<br />

So today, walk confidently in this truth: you are His masterpiece. Everything about you exists to make His greatness more fully known. **Live for His glory, because that’s what you were made for.**
