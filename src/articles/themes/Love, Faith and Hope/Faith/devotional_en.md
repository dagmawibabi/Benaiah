Life with God is like a barefoot dance with a partner in a wild field full of thorns and thistles (with your eyes covered, of course). When we can’t see where we are stepping, our only way to survive is to trust our dance partner and ensure we are aligning ourselves with their moves. Just as the dancer with their eyes covered clings for dear life to their partner's movements, so too should we cling to God’s guidance and let Him lead us wherever He wants in the dance of life. Dancing on a ground filled with thorns and thistles may seem overwhelming, but life itself is such a ground—filled with ups and downs, most of which we cannot anticipate.

<br />

However, when we read 2 Corinthians 5:7, which says, “For we walk by faith, not by sight,” we are reminded that 'walk' is an active term. Walking by faith is not merely an occasional act reserved for significant life decisions but for an everyday event, encompassing both the highs, the lows and everything in between. We can't trust God for the big things while taking care of the everyday smaller things by ourselves. God knows the burden of having to navigate life on our own as we walk by sight, and He wants to free us from it by inviting us to walk in faith. As we surrender to His leading of our steps, we can actually dance through the thorns of life with Him. Through His Word, God calls us to give up our reliance on sight and embrace a journey of faith with Him in everyday life.
