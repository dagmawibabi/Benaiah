In life, we often face storms that terrify us, leaving us frozen in fear, unable to move an inch from where we stand. We’re gripped by the fear that the promised light at the shore-the end of the race-dims, and we no longer feel the light of hope in our hearts. Desperately, we cling to the wheel of the ship, grasping at every corner and every person we can find. Yet, in doing so, we forget the true light we need—the one we should rely on and hope for. The Captain, who holds the helm and commands the movement of every ocean and sea, is the faithful and honest God.

<br />

We rattle with doubt and despair, questioning the truth of our hope. We get confused and try to shake off the realness of the faithfulness of God (our Captain). In those seasons, we need to remind our soul of the authenticity of the hope that God placed in our heart. Our hope is not a wish or a distant ideal; our hope is the one and only God who holds the universe in His bare hands, the one who sails the ship. Even if the storm rages on, we can rest by trusting His choices and ways, for our hope is reality grounded in the truth of His character.
