Ever catch yourself wondering if that ride-or-die kind of love is even real? A Love that doesn't ghost you when life gets messy like, the kind that sticks around through the chaos and feels like a cozy blanket on a bad day? Well, spoiler: it's 100% real. And here's the kicker - **it's already yours**, right here, right now.
Here's the deal: God's love isn't reserved for a select few. It's for everyone. For the one who feels unlovable sometimes, who’s been let down or betrayed, who wonders if real love even exists, the one who laughs too loud, cries when no one’s looking, and secretly wonders if you’re enough. You, with all the doubts, the fears, and the questions you have, He sees it all, and loves you.

<br/>

In fact, the Bible reminds us of how deep God’s love goes: _“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life”_ (John 3:16 NIV). While this verse reveals the Father's love in sending His Son, Jesus carried out that love by willingly giving His life, he proved it by showing the depth of God's love in action! To show you just how much you're worth. So, when you catch yourself wondering if real, unshakeable love exists: it does, and it's yours.

<br/>

He's saying, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28 NIV). You don’t need to clean up first. You are welcome to come to Him exactly as you are, no matter the mess. He’s already here, arms wide open, waiting. So, why chase worldly love that fades? Take a breath, let go of the pressure, and lean into the love that's been waiting for you all along.
